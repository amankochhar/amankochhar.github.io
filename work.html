								<h2><a>Work Experience</a></h2>
								<h3>Data Engineer @Spotify - Feb 2023 - Present</h3>
									<p>
										I'm working on solutions to help streamline the podcast delivery as well as consumption process. I have built solutions to track user behavior
										and performance of podcast episodes for organizations and content creators. I have also implemented solutions that helped reduce the runtime
										and saved around $100k per month.
									</p>
								<h3>Data Engineer @Meta - Nov 2021 - Jan 2023</h3>
									<p>
										I worked on optimizing the load times of videos and reels on the platform for billions of DAUs and MAUs. I built pipelines and solutions that
										analyzed billions of rows of daily data to figure out the anomalies and slowdowns in the app. I worked across teams to devise solutions and
										deploy improvements that reduced the load times by ~4% 
									</p>
								<h3>Lead Data Engineer @Thrive Market - Jan 2020 - Nov 2021</h3>
									<p>
										I was incharge of all the data needs of the entire e-commerce platform. I lead and managed a team of 5 DEs and we worked extensively on personalization
										and building robust solutions and pipelines to handle the availability and consistency requirements of an e-commerce business.
									</p>
								<h3>Senior Data Engineer @VideoAmp - Oct 2017 - Oct 2019</h3>
									<p>
										My first full-time job was working on an ad serving platform. The platform would bid for ads on platforms like You Tube and NY Times and bid and
										load the ad on the page before it finishes loading up. The system was written in Scala and had a SLA of 50 milli-seconds. I learned a lot about 
										high throughput systems running at scale and ins and outs of Apache Spark, AWS and Kubernetes from some of the experts in the industry.
									</p>
								<h3>Data Engineer Fellow @Insight Fellowship - May-Oct 2017</h3>
									<p>I started my career with a fellowship where I worked for a startup to deliver a solution to engage new players and also developed an analytics dashboard 
										to monitor the health and metrics in production. I learned how to use GCP and it's different offerings, deploying things in production and the rigourous
										testing that goes along with it.
									</p>
								<h3>Master's in Computer Science @VCU - Graduated 2017</h3>
									<p>
										Learned the ins and outs of distributed computing and big data computation via coursework and projects like song recommendation system, humor detection
										in tweets, ensemble learning, KNN algorithm in GPUs, proximal gradient descent etc.
									</p>
