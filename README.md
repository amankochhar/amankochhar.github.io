## Welcome to My Website

I'm a Computer Science student interested in everything related to Big Data and Machine Learning. In my free time I try to implement different machine learning models and get insights on various structured and unstructured datasets I find throughout the internet.

In this site I plan on posting my code and discuss the decisions I make while tackling various problems. Also, feel free to comment on the code and the content on this site as I'll highly appreciate any constructive criticism towards my coding style and the projects I publish.

For now I'll try to add my existing repositories to this site and as we move on I'll add all the future ones in here as well.
